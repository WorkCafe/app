# WorkCafe App

WorkCafe is a community maintained list of coffee shops/caf√©s friendly to work from.

Uses GeoJSON. Hosted on GitHub.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WorkCafe/app.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WorkCafe/app)

This is the application that powers the website.

It is written in Ember.js and uses Bootstrap.

It is based on [Broccoli Boilerplate](https://github.com/iMedicare/emberjs-broccoli-boilerplate).

## Contributions

Edit the files inside the `data` repository and send a pull request.

### Adding your city

Edit the `data/cities.json` file.

### Adding a new venue

The city venue files use GeoJSON format.
To find more about GeoJSON check [the GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github).

If your city venue file exists, you should find it inside the `data/locations/` folder.

You will want to edit it and append a new entry to `features`.

If you city does not exist, create a new one using the same filename as the city ID.

Check the existing files for boilerplate data before creating a new file.

## Development

You will need Node.js installed first.

We use `nvm` to get Node up and running.

Once set, follow the installation steps:

    $ npm install -g bower
    $ npm install -g broccoli-cli
    $ npm install -g testem
    $ npm install

Use `bower.json` to manage third-party dependencies.

Inside the `app` folder, you will find an idiomatic Ember application structure.

Use JavaScript ES6 syntax and CoffeeScript to write JavaScript.

Use Less to write CSS.

The application has Twitter Bootstrap framework bundled. Make sure you make use
of provided widgets and UI components as much as possible.

* [Less reference](http://lesscss.org/functions/)
* [ES6 reference](https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler#supported-es6-module-syntax)

## Usage

Broccoli is our build tool. To run the development server use:

    $ broccoli serve

To build a release, use:

    $ rm -rf dist
    $ BROCCOLI_ENV=production broccoli build ./dist

### Testing

We are using QUnit to write tests.

Some simple conventions:

* Every feature needs an acceptance test
* Unit test are mandatory for libraries or parts of the code with complex logic

To run the tests change the environment to `test` and run `broccoli`:

    $ BROCCOLI_ENV=test broccoli serve

Open the browser, QUnit runner should start on its own.

From command line, you can run the tests using `testem`:

    $ rm -rf ./build && BROCCOLI_ENV=test broccoli build ./build && testem ci -l phantomjs,firefox

### Deployments

There is another repository with the compiled files mapped to the `workcafe.in` domain name.

Use Broccoli to make a production build.
And overwrite the old files in the [workcafe.github.io](https://github.com/WorkCafe/workcafe.github.io) with the new ones.
